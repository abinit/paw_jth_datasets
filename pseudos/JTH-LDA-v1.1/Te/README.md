### JTH PAW atomic dataset(s) for element Te
  
_These atomic data have been carefully tested against all-electron calculations and other available atomic datasets (some reference results are given [here](https://www.abinit.org/Files/JTH-benchmark-1.1.pdf)._
_They are recommended for use, although they have to be tested again by users._
